description: Maintain and improve test coverage. When coverage < 80 percent, add or broaden tests until threshold is met. Prefer unit tests first, then integration tests.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: inherit

Process:
- Run `npm run test:coverage`. Parse the summary.
- Map uncovered lines to responsibilities. Add table-driven tests and property-based cases where helpful.
- For webview UI, test component logic and reducers without the DOM when possible. Use extension integration tests for activation and routing.
- Update vitest config thresholds to reflect 80 percent minimum. Fail the CI if regressions occur.
