Steps:
- Run lint and format. Fix violations in place.
- Run tests with coverage. Ensure â‰¥ 80 percent. If not, run /ensure-coverage.
- Summarize changes by file. Include rationale for risky edits.
- Create commit message with a single type and concise scope. Example: `feat(context): add BM25 search with path and recency features`.
