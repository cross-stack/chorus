> **Transform code reviews into learning-centered, equitable, and evidence-first decision spaces**

Chorus helps developer teams surface hidden context, reduce conformity pressure, and make evidence-based decisions during code reviews. Built as a VS Code/Positron extension with local-first privacy principles.

## 🎯 Vision

Code reviews should be spaces for learning and evidence-based decision making, not battles of opinion or conformity pressure. Chorus transforms your review process by:

- **Surfacing Context**: Automatically discover relevant PRs, commits, docs, and discussions
- **Requiring Evidence**: Structured templates for tests, benchmarks, specs, and risk assessment
- **Promoting Equity**: Blinded first-pass reviews and quiet ballots to reduce bias

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 **Context Discovery**
- **Smart CodeLens**: "Related context (n)" annotations on changed files
- **Git History Indexing**: Automatic scanning of commits and documentation
- **Relevance Ranking**: BM25-style scoring to surface the most relevant context
- **Documentation Integration**: Indexes README files, ADRs, and specs

### 📊 **Evidence-First Reviews**
- **Structured PR Templates**: Required sections for Tests, Benchmarks, Specs, Risk Assessment
- **Test Evidence Parsing**: Smart detection and formatting of Jest/Vitest/generic test output
- **Evidence Validation**: Local validation rules with quick-fixes
- **Copy-Paste Integration**: `Ctrl+Shift+V` to parse clipboard test results

### ⚖️ **Equitable Decision Making**
- **Quiet Ballots**: Anonymous voting with confidence levels (1-5)
- **Blinded Reviews**: Author metadata hidden until first-pass completion
- **Bias Detection**: Language analysis for objective feedback
- **Reveal Controls**: Voluntary author identity disclosure

### 🔒 **Privacy & Security**
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally in SQLite
- **No Network Calls**: Privacy-preserving by design
- **PII Redaction**: Automatic redaction in exports
- **Secure Storage**: Anonymous ballot IDs with optional reveal

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **From VS Code Marketplace** (coming soon):
   ```bash
   code --install-extension chorus.chorus-extension
   ```

2. **From VSIX** (development):
   ```bash
   code --install-extension chorus-extension-0.1.0.vsix
   ```

3. **From Source**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/user/chorus.git
   cd chorus
   npm ci
   cd packages/chorus-extension
   npm ci
   npm run build
   code --install-extension .
   ```

### First Steps

1. **Open the Chorus Panel**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Show Chorus Panel"
2. **Enable CodeLens**: Settings → Extensions → Chorus → Enable Related Context
3. **Start a Review**: Create a PR and use the Chorus Evidence template
4. **Add Evidence**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Add Chorus Evidence Block"

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Context Tab
- View related commits, PRs, and documentation for your changes
- Click items to open in editor or browser
- Use search to filter by keywords or file paths
- Export context reports for stakeholders

### Evidence Tab
- Generate evidence blocks for PR descriptions
- Paste test results from clipboard (supports JSON parsing)
- Validate required fields before submission
- Link to specifications and ADR documents

### Equity Tab
- Submit anonymous ballots on PR decisions
- Set confidence levels and provide rationale
- View aggregated results after first-pass completion
- Control when to reveal your identity

## 🎮 Commands

| Command | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `chorus.showPanel` | `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Open the main Chorus panel |
| `chorus.addEvidence` | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Add evidence block from clipboard |
| `chorus.submitFirstPass` | - | Submit anonymous first-pass ballot |

### Core Principles

- **Local-First**: All data stays on your machine
- **Privacy-Preserving**: No telemetry without explicit opt-in
- **Evidence-Based**: Structured templates require supporting data
- **Bias-Reducing**: Blinded reviews and anonymous ballots
- **Context-Rich**: Automatic discovery of relevant information

## 🧪 Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/chorus.git
cd chorus
npm ci                                    # Install workspace dependencies
cd packages/chorus-extension
npm ci                                    # Install extension dependencies
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run test           # Run unit tests
npm test:coverage      # Run tests with coverage
npm run lint           # ESLint code quality
npm run format         # Prettier code formatting
```

### Testing in VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
3. Test commands and features in the new VS Code window

### Extension Integration Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
npm install @vscode/test-electron

# Run integration tests (requires Xvfb on Linux)
npm run test:integration
```

## 📊 Quality Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: ≥80% lines, functions, branches, statements
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive typing
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier with consistent formatting
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with coverage gates and artifact publishing

## 🤝 Contributing

1. **Fork & Clone**: Create your own fork and clone locally
2. **Branch**: Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. **Develop**: Write code following existing patterns and style
4. **Test**: Ensure tests pass and coverage remains ≥80%
5. **Evidence**: Use the Chorus PR template with evidence blocks
